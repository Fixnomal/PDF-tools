# PDF-tools
Very basic merge/split tools for PDFs. Created this to train developing a simple GUI with tkinter and because I was sick of dealing with Acrobat Reader refusal to do a simple merge of 2 PDFs. Added functionality to merge front and back pages of documents scanned with one sided scanner (interlace).
